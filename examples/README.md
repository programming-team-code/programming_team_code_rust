# Testing Guidelines
- tests are named `[algo].rs`
- use both yosupo and aizu to test whenever possible because bugs have existed on one of the sites but not the other
- when using both sites name the files `[algo]_yosupo.rs` and `[algo]_aizu.rs`
- when only testing a specific function or componenet of some algorithm name the file `[algo]_[component].rs`
