### Mission
To provide a collection of algorithms and data structures useful for competitive programming in Rust.

### Focus
This library is written to be optimized for online contests \[Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.\]

Therefore the code is written with these three pillars:
- **Correctness**: The code should be correct and should pass all test cases.
- **Efficiency**: The code should be efficient and should run within the time limits.
- **Readability**: The code should be readable and should be easy to understand and modify.

Note: the code is **not** written for ICPC style contests and is **not** optimized for code length.

### This repository is currently under construction.
